# Human_computer_interaction
In this repository I've uploaded the code and notebooks I've used to train a military vehicle recognition model.

HCI.ipynb is the notebook containing all the code used to train the model (using python, pytorch and fastai, done in google colab).

Military_vehicle_recognition_HCI.ipynb can be run with voila, resulting in a very simple gui which serves as a military vehicle classifier and allows for the user to upload a picture after which the model will classify the vehicle in the picture.

Segmentation.ipynb contains the code for the training of a pixel segmentation algorithm
